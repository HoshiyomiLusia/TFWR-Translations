# Name Scopes
Scopes determine which variables can be accessed from where. A scope is basically a mapping from names to values.
They work basically the same as in Python.

There is a global scope, and each function has a local scope.
When you define a variable, it gets added to the current scope.
Anything outside of a function definition is considered part of the global scope.

`x = 1`
Assigns a value of `1` to the name `x` in the global scope.

This `def` statement assigns a function to the name `f` in the global scope.
`def f():
    `Assign a value of `1` to the name `y` in the local scope of `f`.`
    y = 1

    `Assign a function to the name `g` in the local scope of `f`.`
    def g():
        pass`

`f()`
Retrieves the function stored in `f` from the global scope and calls it.

`print(y)`
This print statement in the global scope throws an error because `y` was never declared in the global scope so we can't read it here.
It only existed in the local scope of `f`.

## The global keyword
By default all variables in functions bind to the local scope, even if a variable of the same name exists in the global scope.

`x = 0

def f():
    x = 1
f()
print(x)`

This code prints `0` because the local `x` inside `f` is not the same variable as the global `x`, so the global `x` remains unchanged. This is important because otherwise a function call could accidentally override a global variable that just happens to have the same name as a local variable of that function.

If you want to write to a global variable you, you must do so explicitly using the `global` keyword.

`x = 0

def f():
    global x
    x = 1
f()
print(x)`

In this example, `global x` binds `x` to the global variable `x` defined above it. This will now print `1`.
Note that changing global variables is usually the first step towards spaghetti code, where every part of the program affects every other part of the program, so don't overuse it.

## Loops and branches
Loops and branches do not create their own scopes, so anything declared within them can still be used outside.

`for i in range(3):
    pass
print(i)`

This will print `2` because the last iteration of the `for` loop assigned `2` to `i`.
